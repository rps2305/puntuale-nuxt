## Meet the timekeepers

We are strategists, facilitators, and designers who treat time as a shared artifact. We bring calm to the schedule so teams can build what matters.

## How we work together

- We run remote-first with focused in-person sprints.
- We protect 50% of the week for deep work.
- We document every decision in a living timeline.
