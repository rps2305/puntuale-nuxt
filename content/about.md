## About Puntuale

Puntuale was founded as an imaginary studio with a real fascination for time. We ask one question: how should a week feel when it is designed, not endured?

## Our Story

We believe that every challenge is an opportunity to rebalance attention. Our team blends strategy, facilitation, and systems thinking to build schedules that feel deliberate, resilient, and deeply human.

At Puntuale, we do not just solve problems. We design the conditions that let good work show up every day, without the frantic catch-up.

## Our Values

Our values live inside the calendar: every decision, meeting, and handoff should protect attention and build trust.

## Our Team

Meet the specialists who turn chaos into cadence. We are designers, strategists, and facilitators who love building a better week.
